Let $n$ be a positive integer. There are $n$ points in the plane such that any three of them form a triangle of area $1$. Prove that all the points lie inside a triangle of area $4$. 

\item % Kgaogelo

Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers. Show that 
$$(x+y+z)\left(\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}\right) \geq 9$$

The game of Chomp is played on an $n \times n$ board by Dylan (on behalf of SA) and Fionn (on behalf of Ireland) as follows: Dylan moves first. On a players move, they must place an X on any square $(i, j)$ which does not yet have an X on it, and they also fill in an X on any square above and to the right of that square which does not yet have an X on it. That is, any square $(s, t)$ with $s \geq i$ and $t \geq j$ which does not yet have an X also gets an X filled in. The person who places the last X loses. Is there a winning strategy for either player?
