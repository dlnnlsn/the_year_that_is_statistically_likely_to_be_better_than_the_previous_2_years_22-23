\item % Parvardi, Functional Equations Problems
Find all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that \[ f(x+y) = f(x^2+y^2) \] for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.

The game of Chomp is played on an $n \times n$ board by Dylan (on behalf of SA) and Fionn (on behalf of Ireland) as follows: Dylan moves first.
On a players move, they must place an X on any square $(i, j)$ which does not yet have an X on it, and they also fill in an X on any square above and to the right of that square which does not yet have an X on it.
That is, any square $(s, t)$ with $s \geq i$ and $t \geq j$ which does not yet have an X also gets an X filled in.
The person who places the last X loses.
Is there a winning strategy for either player?


\item % Cono Sur Olympiad 1998
An acute triangle $\triangle ABC$ has circumcircle $\Gamma$ and orthocenter $H$.
$M$ is the midpoint of the segment $BC$.
Let $P$ be the point of the intersection of the line $HM$ with the minor arc $BC$ of $\Gamma$.
Let $Q \neq B$ be the intersection of the line $BH$ with $\Gamma$.
Prove that $PQ = BC$.

\item % Parvardi, 100 Polynomial Problems
Find all polynomials $P(x)$ with real coefficients such that
\[ (x-8)P(2x) = 8(x-1)P(x) \]
for all real $x$.


\item % Russian MO, 2015, 10.6
A square is dissected into $n^2$ rectangles, where $n\geq 2$, by $n-1$ horizontal lines and $n-1$ vertical lines. Prove that one may choose $2n$ of these rectangles such that for any two of the chosen rectangles, one can be put completely into the other (perhaps, after some rotation).
