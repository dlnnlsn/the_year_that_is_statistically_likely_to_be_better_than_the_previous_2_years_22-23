A square is dissected into $n^2$ rectangles, where $n\geq 2$, by $n-1$ horizontal lines and $n-1$ vertical lines. Prove that one may choose $2n$ of these rectangles such that for any two of the chosen rectangles, one can be put completely into the other (perhaps, after some rotation).

\textbf{Solution:} We can shuffle rows and columns, so assume W.L.O.G. that $a_1\geq ... \geq a_n$ are the lengths of the rectangles' horizontal sides (from the left to the right), and $b_1\geq ...\geq b_n$ are the lengths of their vertical sides (from the top to the bottom). Let $Q_{i,j}$ be the $a_i\times b_j$ rectangle. Since $a_1+...+a_n=b_1+...+b_n$, we cannot have $a_i<b_i$ for all $i$, or $b_i<a_i$ for all $i$. Thus we have some $k$ such that $a_k\leq b_k$ and some $j$ such that $a_j\geq b_j$, and we also have that for every $i$, one of these is true. This means that we can find an index $k$ such that $a_k\leq b_k$ and $a_{k-1}\geq b_{k-1}$ (or vice versa, but we consider this case without losing generality). Then the required chain of rectangles is $Q_{1,1},Q_{1,2}...Q_{1,k-1},Q_{2,k-1},...,Q_{k,k-1},Q_{k-1,k},Q_{k,k},...,Q_{k,n},Q_{k+1,n},...,Q_{n,n}$. It is clear that all $Q_{i,j}$ can be contained in $Q_{i,j+1}$ and also in $Q_{i+1,j}$. And of course, our case gives that $Q_{k,k-1}$ can be contained in $Q_{k-1,k}$.
