# Stellenbosch Camp 2022

## Overview

A camp is held in December each year. Traditionally, this camp has taken place at the Stellenbosch Univeristy. Students are invited to attend the camp primarily based on their results in the South African Mathematics Olympiad. This camp is the first in a series of camps that makes up the selection and training programme for South Africa's participants in the Pan-African and International Mathematics Olympiads.

Students are divided into three streams: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Intermediate and Advanced students write a test lasting 2.5 hours each morning. The Beginner students also write tests, but only on the first and on the last day. The test on the last day lasts 4 hours instead of 2.5 hours. It has more problems than the other tests, and is also intended to be more difficult.

After the test each morning, and in the afternoons, students attend a series of lectures. These are on topics that are grouped broadly into the traditional olympiad categories of Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, and Combinatorics. Students have free time in the evenings.

### Why are there non-English versions of Test 2?

A student from Ireland attended the camp, and upon discovering that one of the coaches speaks a small amount of French decided to submit solutions for Test 1 in even worse French than said coach is capable of. Since it was now evident that the student's preferred language for writing tests was French, an attempt was made to be accommodating by preparing a French version of Test 2. The plan was to give the student only the French translation of the test. It was anticipated that the student would then request a translation, and so Google Translate was used to prepare an Irish Gaelic version. The coaches were very amused by this hilarious prank until the student decided not to show up for the test at all.
