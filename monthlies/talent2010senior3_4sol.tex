Construct a \emph{cycle} of houses as follows: pick any house as the first house and suppose that, inductively, the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ house has been chosen. Let house $n+1$ be the house which is occupied by the dwarf which occupied the $n^{\textrm{th}}$ house last summer. At some point this sequence must start repeating to form a cycle. If not all the houses have been used up, pick a random house, and construct a new cycle using the above process. 

In this way, all the houses are divided up into several cycles. We now colour the cycles as follows: colour the first house in each cycle green, and colour the remaining houses in each cycle alternately red and white. 

Thus, any dwarf who lived in a green house last summer would be in a red or white house this summer. Similarly, dwarfs who lived in a white house, will move to a red or green house, and dwarfs who lived in a red house will move to a white or green house.
