Suppose that such an enumeration is possible, and let the common edge sum equal $S$. Note that every edge is part of three different triangles, and that there are ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ different triangles. Hence the sum of the numbers on the edges of each triangle must equal $10S$, but every number from 1 to 10 is counted thrice, so we have 
$$10S = 3(1+2+\dots+10) = 3(55) = 165,$$
which gives $S = 16.5$. Since $S$ must be an integer, this is a contradiction. Hence such an enumeration is not possible.
