Note that $a^2 \equiv_4 1$ if $a$ is odd, and $a^2 \equiv_3 1$ if $a$ is not divisible by 3. 

Firstly, if any $a_i$ is even, then $a_i^2$ is divisible by 4. If all the $a_i$ are odd, then $a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots +a_{12}^2 \equiv_4 1 + 1 + \dots + 1 \equiv_4 0$, so the given product is divisible by 4 in both cases. 

Next, if any $a_i$ is divisible by 3, then so is the given product. If no $a_i$ is divisible by 3, then $a_1^2+\dots+a_{12}^2 \equiv_{3} 1+1+\dots+1 \equiv_3 0$, so the given product is divisible by 3 in both cases.

Finally, since $3$ and $4$ are relatively prime, the given product is divisible by $3\times 4 = 12$.
