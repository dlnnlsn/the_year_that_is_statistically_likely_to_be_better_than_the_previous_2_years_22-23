Suppose \wlg\ that the equilateral triangle has side length 1. Note that since the line segments $OA$, $OB$ and $OC$ lie entirely inside the triangle $ABC$, each one of these lengths are less than 1. Also, using the triangle inequality in triangle $AOB$ we get 
$$AO+BO > AB = 1 > CO.$$
Similarly, $BO + CO > AO$ and $AO+CO > BO$. Hence the segments $AO$, $BO$ and $CO$ satisfy all three triangle inequalities, which implies that they form a triangle.
