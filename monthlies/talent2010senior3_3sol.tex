\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \insertdiagramnumber{1}

\item Suppose this is possible, and let $\ell$ be the line containing the 5 midpoints of the sides, and suppose \wlg\ that $\ell$ is horizontal. Note that the vertices of a particular edge must be equidistant from $\ell$, since $\ell$ contains its midpoint. This holds for all 5 of the edges, so all 6 vertices of the hexagon are equidistant from $\ell$, lying alternately above and below $\ell$. In particular, this implies that the midpoint of the sixth edge also lies on $\ell$.

Now consider the leftmost vertex above $\ell$ and the leftmost vertex below $\ell$. Every edge of the hexagon intersects $\ell$; the vertex above $\ell$ must thus connect to two vertices below $\ell$ and the vertex below $\ell$ must connect to two vertices above $\ell$. This leads to at least three edges, two of which must intersect, as in the diagram.
