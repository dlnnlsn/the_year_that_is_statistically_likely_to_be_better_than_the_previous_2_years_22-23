\item % RuMO 2015/16 G9 Q6
We say that a non-empty set $A$ consisting of positive integers is \textit{complete} if for any positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a+b\in A$, the number $ab$ also lies in $A$ (the numbers $a$ and $b$ are not required to be distinct or to belong to $A$). Find all complete sets.


\item % RuMO 2015/16 G9 Q4
Dylan has 11 metal pieces indistinguishable in appearance. He knows that their weights in some order are $1,2,...,11$ kg. He also has a bag that breaks if it contains more than 11 kg (it will not break if it contains exactly 11 kg). Liam knows the weight of each piece and he wants to convince Dylan beyond a shadow of a doubt about which piece has the 1 kg weight. By a `move', Liam can put several pieces into Dylan's bag to demonstrate that the bag is still not broken (He may not break the bag!). Find the least number of moves Liam needs to convince Dylan.

We say that an infinite sequence $a_1, a_2, \dotsc$ is a \emph{binary sequence} if each $a_i$ is equal to $1$ or to $-1$.
Find all binary sequences such that \[ \max\{\abs{a_1}, \abs{2a_1+a_2}, \abs{3a_1+2a_2+a_3}, \abs{4a_1+3a_2+2a_3+a_4}, \dotsc\} = 1. \]


\item % JM-2016-3
Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer and let $x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n$ be positive real numbers such that
\[ x_1 + x_2 + \dotsb + x_n = \frac{1}{x_1^2} + \frac{1}{x_2^2} +\dotsc + \frac{1}{x_n^2} \quad \text{and} \quad x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dotsb + x_n^2 = \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} +\dotsc + \frac{1}{x_n}. \]
Prove that $x_1 = x_2 = \dotsb = x_n =1$.
